> The current API (version 3) will be replaced with the new API (version 4) on February 18, 2021. To help you prepare for your transition, we have made documentation for version 4 of our Public API available at [https://open.gsa.gov/api/regulations.gov](https://open.gsa.gov/api/regulations.gov). API users should plan to transition to the new API by March 11, 2021, when version 3 will be decommissioned.

When Congress passes laws, federal agencies implement those laws through regulations. These regulations vary in subject, but include everything from ensuring water is safe to drink to setting health care standards. Regulations.gov is the place where users can find and comment on regulations. The APIs allow for users to find creative ways to present regulatory data. To learn more about the program visit the [About Us](http://www.regulations.gov/#!aboutProgram) page.
