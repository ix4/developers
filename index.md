> The Regulations.gov API is not accepting applications for new API keys at this time to prepare for the upcoming transition to a modernized Regulations.gov. More information is available [here](https://www.gsa.gov/blog/2020/05/20/gsa-steps-forward-to-modernize-electronic-rulemaking). Please [contact the Regulations.gov Help Desk](mailto:regulations@erulemakinghelpdesk.com), if you have any questions.

When Congress passes laws, federal agencies implement those laws through regulations. These regulations vary in subject, but include everything from ensuring water is safe to drink to setting health care standards. Regulations.gov is the place where users can find and comment on regulations. The APIs allow for users to find creative ways to present regulatory data. To learn more about the program visit the [About Us](http://www.regulations.gov/#!aboutProgram) page.
